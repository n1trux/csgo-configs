# Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

In this repository you'll find a few nice config files for CS:GO. Some of them are Linux only, like the files in `etc/`.

I'm currently maintaining [a private wiki page](http://wiki.crunch.me.uk/guide:csgo) with tips & tricks.

If you want to contribute, feel free to create an Issue or PR.
